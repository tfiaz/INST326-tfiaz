Week 1

This week I used AI (ChatGPT 5.0 to be exact) while working on the exercises to give me 
a refresher on concepts that I wasn't familar with and ones that I have not used in a while.
I especially used it while completing the string handling portion of the exercises. 
I didn't know how .find() and .strip() worked because I didn't use it in any of my other Python
courses. I didn't use AI to give me any code to complete the assignment nor did I use AI 
to debug any of my code for the exercises.

Week 2

This week I used AI to assist me on the exercises. I used AI to give me examples of the topics we
were discussing on the examples that I either forgot and needed a refresher or just did not
know in general. I also used AI this week for my own personal initiatives, especially when it 
came to revising my resume for the upcoming career fairs. I found it very intriging and gave 
me valuable suggestions which I incorporated into my resume.

Week 3

This week I used AI (ChatGPT 5.0) while working on the exercise problems. 
Usually, I have a hard time writing functions in Python, especially setting up the parameters 
when creating a function at first. Using ChatGPT made it easier for me to see how the structure 
should look, and then I could tweak it myself once I understood the flow. It helped me recognize 
patterns in how functions are written, which gave me more confidence when starting from scratch. 
I also noticed that I learn better when I can compare my own attempt with the AIâ€™s example
because I can spot what I was missing. It made the practice feel less frustrating 
and more like a learning opportunity instead of just trial and error.
