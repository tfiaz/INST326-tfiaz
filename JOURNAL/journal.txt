Week 1

This week I used AI (ChatGPT 5.0 to be exact) while working on the exercises to give me 
a refresher on concepts that I wasn't familar with and ones that I have not used in a while.
I especially used it while completing the string handling portion of the exercises. 
I didn't know how .find() and .strip() worked because I didn't use it in any of my other Python
courses. I didn't use AI to give me any code to complete the assignment nor did I use AI 
to debug any of my code for the exercises.

Week 2

This week I used AI to assist me on the exercises. I used AI to give me examples of the topics we
were discussing on the examples that I either forgot and needed a refresher or just did not
know in general. I also used AI this week for my own personal initiatives, especially when it 
came to revising my resume for the upcoming career fairs. I found it very intriging and gave 
me valuable suggestions which I incorporated into my resume.

Week 3

This week I used AI (ChatGPT 5.0) while working on the exercise problems. 
Usually, I have a hard time writing functions in Python, especially setting up the parameters 
when creating a function at first. Using ChatGPT made it easier for me to see how the structure 
should look, and then I could tweak it myself once I understood the flow. It helped me recognize 
patterns in how functions are written, which gave me more confidence when starting from scratch. 
I also noticed that I learn better when I can compare my own attempt with the AI’s example
because I can spot what I was missing. It made the practice feel less frustrating 
and more like a learning opportunity instead of just trial and error.

Week 4

This week I used AI (ChatGPT & Google Gemini) while working on the exercise problems, espeicially
decoding some of the code I was writing. Like for exercise #8, my code had a logic error where
the function set_open_hours wasn't actually updating the open note hour variable. I didn't know why the code
wasn't working so I asked chatGPT and it debugged the code for me and changed the logic and made the code working. For
exercise #10, while I was running my block of code, I kept getting an assertion error on the code. I checked my code and it was 
logically correct and I tweaked it, where I wrote the code in a more inefficient manor, keeping the same logic and it still wasn't 
working. I asked ChatGPT and Gemini and said the code was fine and was not the problem but it was the sample output provided to 
us that was the issue and was causing assertion error. I changed the third parameter "assert r.add_score()" from 3 to 2 and it made
my code work. For exercise 19, I didn't know how to go about solving the code, especially what to write in the function blocks.
I asked ChatGPT what to write, and it gave me the code and it worked flawlessly. Suprisingly, this week, I didn't need to use 
much AI as I had to for the other weeks. 

WEEK 5

This week I used AI (ChatGPT) mainly for my library system project to help me write and debug the code.
At first, my program had indentation and logic errors that were causing the classes not to work properly. 
ChatGPT helped me fix those issues by properly indenting the __init__ methods and showing me how to organize each class.
I also used AI to create new functions for my project, including compute_overdue_fine, checkout_item, and renew_item. 
When I wasn’t sure how to handle overdue items or renewals, ChatGPT explained how to use timedelta from the datetime module 
and how to set limits on renewals.
