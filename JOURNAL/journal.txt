Week 1

This week I used AI (ChatGPT 5.0 to be exact) while working on the exercises to give me 
a refresher on concepts that I wasn't familar with and ones that I have not used in a while.
I especially used it while completing the string handling portion of the exercises. 
I didn't know how .find() and .strip() worked because I didn't use it in any of my other Python
courses. I didn't use AI to give me any code to complete the assignment nor did I use AI 
to debug any of my code for the exercises.

Week 2

This week I used AI to assist me on the exercises. I used AI to give me examples of the topics we
were discussing on the examples that I either forgot and needed a refresher or just did not
know in general. I also used AI this week for my own personal initiatives, especially when it 
came to revising my resume for the upcoming career fairs. I found it very intriging and gave 
me valuable suggestions which I incorporated into my resume.

Week 3

This week I used AI (ChatGPT 5.0) while working on the exercise problems. 
Usually, I have a hard time writing functions in Python, especially setting up the parameters 
when creating a function at first. Using ChatGPT made it easier for me to see how the structure 
should look, and then I could tweak it myself once I understood the flow. It helped me recognize 
patterns in how functions are written, which gave me more confidence when starting from scratch. 
I also noticed that I learn better when I can compare my own attempt with the AI’s example
because I can spot what I was missing. It made the practice feel less frustrating 
and more like a learning opportunity instead of just trial and error.

Week 4

This week I used AI (ChatGPT & Google Gemini) while working on the exercise problems, espeicially
decoding some of the code I was writing. Like for exercise #8, my code had a logic error where
the function set_open_hours wasn't actually updating the open note hour variable. I didn't know why the code
wasn't working so I asked chatGPT and it debugged the code for me and changed the logic and made the code working. For
exercise #10, while I was running my block of code, I kept getting an assertion error on the code. I checked my code and it was 
logically correct and I tweaked it, where I wrote the code in a more inefficient manor, keeping the same logic and it still wasn't 
working. I asked ChatGPT and Gemini and said the code was fine and was not the problem but it was the sample output provided to 
us that was the issue and was causing assertion error. I changed the third parameter "assert r.add_score()" from 3 to 2 and it made
my code work. For exercise 19, I didn't know how to go about solving the code, especially what to write in the function blocks.
I asked ChatGPT what to write, and it gave me the code and it worked flawlessly. Suprisingly, this week, I didn't need to use 
much AI as I had to for the other weeks. 

WEEK 5

This week I used AI (ChatGPT) mainly for my library system project to help me write and debug the code.
At first, my program had indentation and logic errors that were causing the classes not to work properly. 
ChatGPT helped me fix those issues by properly indenting the __init__ methods and showing me how to organize each class.
I also used AI to create new functions for my project, including compute_overdue_fine, checkout_item, and renew_item. 
When I wasn’t sure how to handle overdue items or renewals, ChatGPT explained how to use timedelta from the datetime module 
and how to set limits on renewals.

WEEK 6

This week I used AI (ChatGPT) to help me work through the Week 6 exercises, which focused on classes, object creation, 
nd basic object-oriented design. I ran into issues with initializing class attributes correctly and understanding how methods 
interact with instance variables. ChatGPT helped clarify how constructors work, how to properly use self, and how to structure 
methods so they return expected outputs. It also helped me debug small logic errors that were causing incorrect results. 
Overall, AI made it easier to understand the fundamentals of classes and improved my confidence working with object-oriented code.

WEEK 7

This week, I used ChatGPT to assist me with coding exercises focused on exception handling and basic unit testing. 
The AI helped me write and refine Python functions like validate_isbn, parse_copies, and assert_not_overdue, ensuring they 
followed Week 7’s requirements without using advanced concepts. It also guided me in applying try, except, else, and finally 
correctly while maintaining clear and readable code. I used it to check my understanding of how and when to raise custom 
exceptions and how to structure simple unittest cases. Overall, ChatGPT acted as a helpful coding partner that sped up my 
work while allowing me to focus on understanding the logic behind error handling and testing.

WEEK 8

This week I used AI (ChatGPT) to help me develop and debug my library system project. 
I had several issues with subclassing, method overriding, and logic errors that caused my classes not to function correctly. 
ChatGPT guided me in fixing these problems by organizing my class hierarchy, using super() correctly, and showing how to implement 
polymorphism without relying on if statements. It also helped me create new functions like late_fee, effective_loan_period, and 
sort_books_for_display, and explained how to use composition by adding a Notifier class to handle messages. 
Overall, AI made it easier to understand inheritance, polymorphism, and cleaner code design in my project. 

WEEK 9

This week I used AI (ChatGPT) to help me develop and debug my library system project. I had several issues with subclassing, 
method overriding, and logic errors that caused my classes not to function correctly. ChatGPT guided me in fixing these 
problems by organizing my class hierarchy, using super() correctly, and showing how to implement polymorphism without 
relying on if statements. It also helped me create new functions like late_fee, effective_loan_period, and sort_books_for_display, 
and explained how to use composition by adding a Notifier class to handle messages. Overall, AI made it easier to understand 
inheritance, polymorphism, and cleaner code design in my project.

WEEK 10

This week I used AI (ChatGPT) to assist with the Week 10 exercises, which involved more advanced object-oriented concepts and 
applying them in practice. I needed help understanding how to structure classes more efficiently and how different components 
of a program should interact with each other. ChatGPT helped me debug errors, improve method logic, and write cleaner, more 
readable code. It also reinforced concepts like abstraction and code reuse, which helped me better understand how larger programs 
are organized. Overall, AI helped streamline my problem-solving process and strengthened my understanding of object-oriented 
programming.

WEEK 12

This week, I used AI (ChatGPT 5.1) to apply for internships. I would find internship postings for data related positions and use AI to break down
overall fit of the position based on my resume, shaped my cover letter based on my resume, calculate applicant tracking score (ATS)
based on my resume, and the likelihood of a recruiter looking at my resume and scheduling an interview. I also used AI to help me
structure emails to recruiters and company workers that I would find for a specific role at their company and this resulted in a few 
responses as well. I also used AI to help me structure my draft for another class without using any of the information the AI gave. 
It gave me a great structure for my draft and I incorporated part, but not all, to my project draft. 

WEEK 13

I used AI to help structure and refine SQL queries for a project of mine. The AI helped translate research questions
(for example, diabetes rates by age, income, and health indicators) into clear SQL logic and aggregation queries, 
which saved time and reduced errors. I used AI to analyze internship job descriptions and identify key skills and responsibilities 
to highlight on my resume. This helped me tailor my resume language to better match roles in operations,
analytics, and finance-related internships. I used AI while working on Project 4 to support system integration, 
data persistence, and testing. AI helped generate and refine unit, integration, and system tests using Python’s 
unittest framework, particularly for validating end-to-end workflows and save/load and import/export functionality. 
I also used AI to assist with file I/O patterns, error handling, and refactoring during integration to ensure components worked 
together correctly. Additionally, AI was used to help organize documentation (README, testing strategy, and architecture overview) 
and prepare points for the project video explaining how we verified the system works.
