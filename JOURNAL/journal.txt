Week 2

This week I used AI to assist me on the exercises. I used AI to give me examples of the topics we
were discussing on the examples that I either forgot and needed a refresher or just did not
know in general. I also used AI this week for my own personal initiatives, especially when it 
came to revising my resume for the upcoming career fairs. I found it very intriging and gave 
me valuable suggestions which I incorporated into my resume.
