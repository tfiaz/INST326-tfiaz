Week 1

This week I used AI (ChatGPT 5.0 to be exact) while working on the exercises to give me 
a refresher on concepts that  I wasn't familar with and ones that I have not used in a while.
I especially used it while completing the string handling portion of the exercises. 
I didn't know how .find() and .strip() worked because I didn't use it in any of my other Python
courses. I didn't use AI to give me any code to complete the assignment nor did I use AI 
to debug any of my code for the exercises.
