Week 1

This week I used AI (ChatGPT 5.0 to be exact) while working on the exercises to give me 
a refresher on concepts that  I wasn't familar with and ones that I have not used in a while.
I especially used it while completing the string handling portion of the exercises. 
I didn't know how .find() and .strip() worked because I didn't use it in any of my other Python
courses. I didn't use AI to give me any code to complete the assignment nor did I use AI 
to debug any of my code for the exercises.

Week 2

This week I used AI to assist me on the exercises. I used AI to give me examples of the topics we
were discussing on the examples that I either forgot and needed a refresher or just did not
know in general. I also used AI this week for my own personal initiatives, especially when it 
came to revising my resume for the upcoming career fairs. I found it very intriging and gave 
me valuable suggestions which I incorporated into my resume.
